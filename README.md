# helm
Just a repo to host charts that I've built.

## Guestbook
The guestbook chart is from a course that I took on plurasight
Course link: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/kubernetes-packaging-applications-helm


## Useful Helm command
helm install chart chartname -n namespace     (if default namespace, ommit -n namespace)
helm delete chartname -n namespace
